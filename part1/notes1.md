# a) Introduction to React

## how to get started

```bash
npm create vite@latest $NAME -- --template react
cd $NAME
npm install
npm run dev
```

## React

React, a javascript library, uses components that are equivilant to functions, that we'll use to make parts of our
page. These components, just like functions, can accept arguments, be called multiple times and multiple places,
and we have to default export one of these components in every jsx file. Keep in mind that every React component should
have it's first letter capatilized and it can


- **Rules:**
    1. There has to be one defualt export in our jsx file
    2. The name of the component has to have a capatilized first letter
    3. It can only return one root element

# b) JavaScript

...OBJECT: this syntax copies the OBJECT and inserts it, this can be used when handling events, since for updating
states, we don't want to directly change the object, but we want to make a new one, and this can help us copy the
object easier and modify it that way

## Web programmers oath

Programming is hard, that is why I will use all the possible means to make it easier

- I will have my browser developer console open all the time
- I progress with small steps
- I will write lots of console.log statements to make sure I understand how the code behaves and to help pinpointing problems
- If my code does not work, I will not write more code. Instead I will start deleting the code until it works or just return to a state when everything was still working
- When I ask for help in the course Discord channel or elsewhere I formulate my questions properly, see here how to ask for help
